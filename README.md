# Pokemon Auction App

This app was created for module IS631 Modern Software Solution. This app is similar to Carousell, serving as a online solution for buying/selling cards. Our innovation is through the use of a PSA grader to pre-grade the cards to ensure that cards being sold are genuine, and the buyer does not get scammed.

## Installation

---

### Installing SQLite3

To run the database, we use SQLite3 since it is a simple database for the webapp for now. In the future, we can run database on cloud sources.

1. Go to the [SQLite3 Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and download the correct version of SQLite3 depending on your computer's version
2. Extract out all packages and add them to the folder in `C:\User\YOUR_USERNAME`
3. Add the file to the environment variables
   3.1 Go to Start Bar and type `Edit environment variables for your account` ![Environment Variables](docs/environment_variables.jpg)
   3.2 Go to user variables, and then click on `Path` ![Path](docs/user_variables.jpg)
   3.3 Add a new path for SQLite so that you can run it on your current user ![Add_Path](docs/add_sqlite.jpg)
   3.4 Press Ok to close all environment variables path.

To verify the proper installation of SQLite3, close all open command prompts / terminals and run the following command

```
sqlite3
```

You should see SQLite3 command line.

### Install Python Packages

Below are the packages required for Python. If you need anymore, please add them to this list.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
pip install uvicorn
pip install fastapi
pip install python-multipart
pip install pytesseract
```

## Setting up the DB

This step is similar to lesson 4 where you run a simple data server.

```
# Init alembic
alembic init migrations
```

Open `alchemic.ini` file and change the sqlite database URL

```
# Change Alchemy URL
sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///./app.db
```

Configure the `migrations/env.py` file to contain models and include meta data

```
from app.db.db import Base
from app.models.auction import Auction
from app.models.card import Card
from app.models.profile import Profile
from app.models.notications import Notification

target_metadata = Base.metadata
```

Create Migration File

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Init Auction App"
```

Apply Migration

```
alembic upgrade head
```

## Running the Application

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Installing Tesseract OCR

## Download Tesseract:

Go to [the Tesseract Download Page](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).  
Download the correct version based on your computer's operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

## Install Tesseract:

Follow the installation steps provided on the download page.  
Take note of the installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`).

### **Adding Tesseract to Environment Variables (Windows)**

1. Go to the **Start Menu** and search for **Edit environment variables**.
2. Under **User Variables**, select **Path** and click **Edit**.
3. Click **New**, then add the Tesseract installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`).
4. Click **OK** to save changes and close the window.

### **Verify Tesseract Installation**
